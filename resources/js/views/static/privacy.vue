        security, is information that can be used on its own or with other
        information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to
        identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy
        carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect

      <h2>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</h2>
      <p>On our Privacy Policy Page</p>
      <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
      <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
        law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.
      </p>
      <h2>
        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
        following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We will notify you via email</li>
        <li>Within 7 business days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
        individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
        data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
        principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
        against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
        government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
        data processors.
      </p>
